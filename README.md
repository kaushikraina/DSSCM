Landslides are the third most deadly natural disasters, and more than thousands die, with $400 billion being spent on landslide disaster management, worldwide, every year. In India, landslides take a heavy toll on life and property; studies show that more than 12 percent of the land area is susceptible to landslides, with an annual toll of 300+ deaths. Heeding this information, this report focuses on our work as we try to minimise these losses by the application of suitable control measures.
The project aims at the implementation of Analytic Hierarchy Process algorithm on SafeLandâ€™s Decision support matrix for obtaining the most suitable control measures to handle landslides, worldwide. Data used was the Decision support matrix which is filled with the expert scores for all 45 control measures with respect to the 6 factors. The control measures are obtained after the implementation of Analytic Hierarchy Process on Decision Support Matrix. As it is implemented with Linear Weighted Additive algorithm, the results from these algorithms can be compared with the most accurate and cost effective measure being selected at the end.
The Analytic Hierarchy Process has the concept of consistency measure, in our implementation the consistency ratio came out as an acceptable ratio of less than 10%. Thus, Analytic Hierarchy Process algorithm was successfully implemented. 
Topics related to this algorithm, its working and the outputs with respect to our goal will be touched upon to get a thorough knowledge of the working procedure. The basic aim of the research i.e. to select the most suitable mitigation measure to minimise the damages caused by landslides will be seen accomplished.
